# Getting Started
Any existing study that is formatted to display on the [Full Design Explorer](https://tt-acm.github.io/DesignExplorer/) can be displayed using Design Explorer Lite.  Simply hit the "Get Data" button in the upper right-hand corner of the interface and paste a URL to the location where your CSV and images live.

You can try out a few different sample studies by pasting links to the following Design Explorer Studies:

See [our wiki](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/design_explorer_lite/wiki) for more detailed documentation on how to customize the Design Explorer Lite interface.

# Interface
The interface has been developed to communicate the essence of parametric studies by allowing people to scroll through design spaces using sliders.
